Getting a skeleton app built and editable

Install node 
Install webstorm

New project wizard fails.  From this link:

https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-63693/WebStorm-React-Native-project-creation-doesnt-work

Had to force the version in the string in the new project wizard:

npx --package react-native-cli react-native --version 0.68.2

^^ Went back over this as I didn't want to be on an old version.  Using the manual/command-line to create a new project
All you need is node on your path, npx comes with node
From the directory above the project (i.e. c:\projects):

npx @react-native-community/cli init Metrics

It'll create the project structure (using react native 0.78.0 - lates right now that pulls in react 19)

Later on, went back to react 18 (because I couldn't get victory-native charts working on 19), by using react-native 0.76.7

npx @react-native-community/cli init Metrix2 --version 0.76.7

..but then I couldn't get MY code working so went back to using react native 0.78.0 - lates right now that pulls in react 19

Run instructions for Android:
    • Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected.
    • cd "c:\projects\Metrics" && npx react-native run-android

See below for spinning-up an emulator.  Once it's up...
cd Metrics
npx react-native run-android

^^ This takes a while first-time-round

it's UP!!!

Now create a new project in WebStorm, using "Open" on the new project screen to open the dir.  Looks like it sets up it's  .idea stuff in there

THIS IS ENOUGH!  Editing the file in WebStorm causes edits to be updated on the phone!


--------------------------------------

I find it better performance-wise to run it on the phone.  Just turn on USB Debugging and start the app mormally (npx react-native run-android) and it'll find the phone and run the app on it.


For the emulator
https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated
Install android studio
Set up an emulator

Needed Java:
https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/23/

FFS - compilation errors.  Looks like we need Java 17
https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/17-MR1
Support for Java 17

---------------------------------------

Trying react-navigation
Needed to update react-native in package.json, and make all the other dependencies >=, then do an npm -i to install t hem all
THen ran the commend below, which updates the package.json
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/bottom-tabs react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

---------------------------------------
Icons

npm install react-native-vector-icons
npm install --save-dev @types/react-native-vector-icons
npm install --save @types/react-native-vector-icons

For generating icon sets for the app

---------------------------------------
To release

cd android
gradlew clean
gradlew assembleRelease

adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

Got to use @next version of skia for react 19 and react native 0.78:

https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia/blob/main/apps/docs/docs/getting-started/installation.md

so dependencies re:

npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler @shopify/react-native-skia@next

Then got this error installing victory-native:

npm ERR! code ERESOLVE

Looks like the version labeling string in ski is wonky - it's @"^2.0.0-next.1" which does not look >=1.2.3 as required by victory native.  But it is, it's just  badly formatted
So I forced the install;

npm install --force victory-native
